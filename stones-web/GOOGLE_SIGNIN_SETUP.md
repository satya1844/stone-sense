# Firebase Google Sign-In Setup

## ✅ Code Implementation Complete
Google Sign-In has been implemented in both login and registration pages.

## 🔧 Firebase Console Setup Required

To enable Google Sign-In, you need to configure it in the Firebase Console:

### Step 1: Enable Google Provider
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/stone-sense-f18d2/authentication/providers)
2. Click on **Authentication** → **Sign-in method**
3. Click on **Google** provider
4. Toggle **Enable** to ON
5. Enter your project support email
6. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Configure OAuth (if needed)
1. In the Google provider settings, note the **Web client ID**
2. For production, you may need to configure authorized domains

## 🚀 How It Works

### Login Page (`app/(auth)/login/page.jsx`)
- **Google Sign-In Button** appears at the top
- **Email/Password form** below with divider
- Both methods redirect to `/ask_doc` on success

### Registration Page (`app/(auth)/register/page.jsx`)  
- **Google Sign-In Button** in a card at the top
- **Full registration form** below for email/password
- Both methods redirect to `/ask_doc` on success

## 🎯 User Experience
1. **New users** can click "Continue with Google" → instant account creation → `/ask_doc`
2. **Existing users** can sign in with Google → `/ask_doc`
3. **Email users** can still use the traditional form

## ⚠️ Error Handling
- Popup blocked → clear error message
- Popup closed → user-friendly message  
- Account conflicts → specific guidance
- All errors display below the Google button

## 🔒 Security Features
- Firebase handles OAuth flow securely
- Session cookies still created for server-side auth
- Same middleware protection for all routes
- No credentials stored in client code

## 🧪 Testing
1. Enable Google provider in Firebase Console
2. Visit http://localhost:3002
3. Try "Continue with Google" on login or register
4. Should redirect to `/ask_doc` after authentication

## 📱 Mobile Support
- Popup-based authentication works on desktop
- On mobile, Firebase automatically uses redirect flow
- Same code handles both scenarios
